## ANT简介

1. ANT是什么--根据官网定义：

	Apache Ant is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to drive processes described in build files as targets and extension points dependent upon each other. The main known usage of Ant is the build of Java applications. Ant supplies a number of built-in tasks allowing to compile, assemble, test and run Java applications. Ant can also be used effectively to build non Java applications, for instance C or C++ applications. More generally, Ant can be used to pilot any type of process which can be described in terms of targets and tasks.

	Ant is written in Java. Users of Ant can develop their own "antlibs" containing Ant tasks and types, and are offered a large number of ready-made commercial or open-source "antlibs".

2. ANT不是什么--根据[官网材料][0]:

	Ant is not a workflow engine
	Ant is a build tool. It was created to compile and package code, and along the way has learned about JUnit testing, rudimentary deployment, and other things. Yet it has remained focused on the problem of build-time preparation of code, documentation and other artifacts of a software project.

	Every so often, somebody tries to use it as a general purpose workflow engine. These people usually get into trouble, for the following reason: General Purpose Workflow is Complicated. The complexity with workflow is specifying the fault handling, when user intervention is needed, how to handle failures of an operation. Transactions, retries, timeouts, all are features of a workflow system -along with parallel execution of operations, fault tolerant execution, and other needed features.

	Ant is not a workflow engine, as it lacks:

	Persistent state. If the ant process dies, all explicit record of the state is lost. In a build, this is not a problem; file artifacts are still present, and rebuilds are the best action.
	Fault handling. In a build process, task failure often means something is seriously wrong and needs fixing. In a workflow, exception handling logic allows for failures to be handled automatically. Note that AntContrib has a `<trycatch>` task that provides some failure handling.
	Parallel operation. Yes, there is a `<parallel>` task, but it gets complex to use. Also, you need to be sure that all the tasks that are used in parallel are safe to be used re-entrantly.
	Better model of state. Ant's write-once model of properties is ideal for a build process in which outer build files can control inner builds. But it does not work when state is really something that is associated with individual jobs going through the pipeline.
	Accordingly, we do not encourage people to try and use ant as a workflow engine. Ant can be used as an execution tool to perform work in the context of a workflow engine, but it is very dangerous and unwise to use it as a workflow engine. It may work at first, but you will soon discover its limitations.

3. ant可以用来做什么

	一般来说，ant用来执行构建过程，包括包含编译、集成、测试、运行。

	当然也可以用ANT来发布，ant支持`copy,scp,sshsession,sshexec`等命令，完全可以用来实现发布。

	ant配合ivy task也可以进行依赖管理。

4. ant跟maven的区别

	maven有约定的目录结构，有生命周期，生命周期上有一套默认的绑定操作，因而是声明式的。
	maven有依赖管理。而ant则非常类似linux下的make工具，提供了目标以及目标依赖管理和内建命令，构建过程需要自己定义。
	虽然ant的抽象层次上是提供了目标以及目标依赖管理，但是并不能把ant作为一个工作流引擎，这一点上面已经说明了。

## ANT结构与工作模型

### ANT的启动

### 任务的运行

### 外部命令的运行

外部命令有两种运行方式，一种是spawn一种是execute，二者区别在于是否是同步？

## ANT的扩展点

## ANT如何发布maven构件

http://maven.apache.org/general.html#maven-ant-tasks

ant是怎么运行的
比如fork这里
```brush:xml
	<target name="run" depends="jar">
        <java jar="${jar.dir}/${ant.project.name}.jar" fork="true"/>
    </target>
```


似乎扩展ant包括三部分：

扩展点

三方task

自定义task

antcall又是什么

build文件包含

path file fileset

依赖的库怎么导入
	path
	ivy？
	maven？


ant本身的build文件就是个迷


build文件有模式可循吗

<----------------------------------------------------------------------->
task的请求输出可以直接使用scanf或者inputHandler

使用scanf可能在某些继承IDE中无法工作

```
        final InputHandler h = handler == null
            ? getProject().getInputHandler()
            : handler.getInputHandler();

        h.handleInput(request);
```


project的输入：inputhandler 输出：log  listener：defaultlog antclassloader

<----------------------------------------------------------------------->
如果一个Task定义了输入与输出，就要交给redirector来处理输出输出：Java.java L752





-lib -nouserlib classpath是怎么工作的

ant的classloader又是怎么工作的

ant的build达成了几个包

现在可以肯定的是ant的某些内部任务运行依赖于三方jar
